# Programmieren

*When I am programming, I am at a nexus. My thoughts become concrete. My ideas transform illusion into reality. The structure of existence is remade before my very eyes. I become a vessel for the creative force of the universe. I am carried aloft as if on the wings of dragons. Why should I care if nobody knows my name?*
