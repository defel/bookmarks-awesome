## Why?

I used delicious for a long time and then getpocket, but I never found any bookmarks later, because of this timeline-think .. and tagging bookmarks also does not work well. Sometimes you tag them *js* the othertime *javascript* the other time just *web*. I want my bookmarks relevant for a domain on one page, structured in lists and divided by headlines for different topic. Organising my bookmarks in markdown files felt like a good idea, after I saw all these awesome-something lists on github. Now I can organize my bookmarks, give them structure and add code-snippets .. much better.
